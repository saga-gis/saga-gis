Average	
Average 2 With Thereshold for Grids calculates average in X and Y distances unsing only the values that differ form central pixel less than a specified threshold. Each value has a weight which is inversely proportional to the distance (method 1).	
Average 3 With Thereshold for Grids calculates average in X and Y distances unsing only the values that differ form central pixel less than a specified threshold. Each value has a weight which is inversely proportional to the distance (method 2).	
Average With Mask 1	
Average With Mask 1 calculates average for cells specified by a mask grid. Cell excluded by the mask grid are NOT used in the average calculation.	
Average With Mask 2	
Average With Mask 2 calculates average for cells specified by a mask grid. However cell excluded by the mask grid are used in the average calculation for right pixels.	
Average With Thereshold 1	
Average With Thereshold 2	
Average With Thereshold 3	
Average With Thereshold for Grids calculates average in X and Y distances unsing only the values that differ form central pixel less than a specified threshold. It's useful to remove noise whit a known maximum reducing the loss of informations

The GeoTRANS engine could not be initialized !!\n\n	
The LAS output file.	
The Topographic Wetness Index: ln( Area / tan(Slope) )	
The angle between the surface and the incoming light beams, measured in radians.	
The column holding the X-coordinate.	
The column holding the Y-coordinate.	
The column holding the Z-coordinate.	
The delay after the start of rainfall, before the discharge starts to rise.	
The grid to filter.	
The grids geo-reference must be related either to the center or the corner of its lower left grid cell.	
The inverse selection is not implemented for input shapefiles with more than one polygon!	
The method used to identify surface specific points.	
The numbers (starting from 1) of the fields to use for clustering, separated by semicolon, e.g. \"4;5;7\"	
The point cloud to export.	
The resulting grid gives the altitude above the channel network in the same units as the elevation data.	
The terrain exaggeration factor allows to increase the shading contrasts in flat areas.	
The transmittance of the atmosphere, usually between 60 and 80 percent.	
The unobstructed hemisphere given as percentage.	
The values in the specified radius is used in the average calculation only if its difference with the central value is lesser or equal to this threshold.	
The values of the resultant grid can be either the seed value (e.g. the local maximum) or the enumerated segment id.

This grid indicates the cells you want calculate the average.	
This grid is used to select cells.	
This is a Test!!!	
This is a floating point value parameter with double precision (8 bytes).	
This is the horizontal component of the overland flow	
This is the vertical component of the overland flow	
This must be your input data of type grid.	
This must be your input data of type shapes.	
This optional grid output contains the interpolated channel network base level elevations.	
This shapes layer will contain the resulting channel network in vector format (lines).	
This value is ignored if set to zero.	
This value is used as constant if no vapour pressure grid is given.	
This version uses all valid cells (not \'no data\' values) of given target grid to determine the contributing area.	
This will contain your output data of type grid.	
This will contain your output data of type shapes.
