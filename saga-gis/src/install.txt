SAGA 2.0 Installation Instructions

_____________________________________________________________________
1 Simple User Installation

1.0 General

This chapter describes what to do, if you simply want to use SAGA.


1.1 MS-Windows

version: SAGA 2.0b (December 7, 2005)
download: http://sourceforge.net/projects/saga-gis/
file: saga_2.0b_051207_wxmsw_vc.zip

Unzip all files to a directory of your choice. You can immediately start working 
with SAGA. Simply find the file 'saga_gui.exe' and execute it. Then the first 
you should do is to load some are all of the module libraries, that come with 
SAGA. To do this choose 'Modules  Load Module Library' in the SAGA main menu. 
You find the libraries in the subfolder 'modules' of your SAGA installation path.

1.2 Linux

version: SAGA 2.0b (December 7, 2005)
download: http://sourceforge.net/projects/saga-gis/
file: saga_2.0b_051207_wxgtk.tar.gz

Unzip all files to a directory of your choice. To run SAGA 2.0 you first have to 
copy SAGA's API library 'libsaga_api.so' to a location, that is listed in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
environment variable. Copy the library into one of the standard directories (e.g., 
/usr/lib) and run ldconfig. If you can't or don't want to install the library in 
a standard place (e.g., you don't have the right to modify /usr/lib), then you 
might want to add the library's location to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment 
variable:

$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/saga_2.0:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

Now find the file 'saga_gui' and execute it (make sure the executable flag is 
set). Now the next you should do is to load some are all of the module libraries, 
that come with SAGA. To do this choose 'Modules  Load Module Library' in the 
SAGA main menu. You find the libraries in the subfolder 'modules' of your SAGA 
installation path.

Remarks:
SAGA depends on GTK+2. wxWidgets has not to be installed, because the
wxWidgets libraries have been statically linked to SAGA 2.0.

2 Scientific Developer Installation

2.0 General

This chapter describes how to install SAGA, if you want not only to use it but 
also plan to develop own module libraries. For your convenience you do not need 
to follow the installation procedure, that is described in chapter 3. You only 
need access to some of the SAGA API header files and the SAGA API library. 
Anyway, to make it as easy as possible, we...


2.0.0 Install the SAGA sources

version: SAGA 2.0b (December 7, 2005)
download: http://sourceforge.net/projects/saga-gis/
file: saga_2.0b_051207_src.zip

Create a folder where you want to install SAGA, e.g.

>md D:\saga

and unzip the sources to this folder. Keep the original folder structure as 
given by the zip file. All SAGA source files should now be located in a 
subfolder 'src'.


2.0.1 Install SAGA binaries

Basically you just need to follow the instructions of chapter 1 'Simple User 
Installation' of this installation guide. But choose as destination a subfolder 
of your saga source folder with respect to the following naming convention:
a) MS Windows: [SAGA installation path]\bin\saga_vc
b) Linux: [SAGA installation path]\bin\saga_gtk

Example:
>md D:\saga\bin
>md D:\saga\bin\saga_vc

2.0.2 Environment settings

a) MS Windows
Add an environment variable with the path to your SAGA sources, e.g.:

>SET SAGA = D:\saga_2

b) Linux
Go to the folder of the SAGA API sources, i.e:

>cd [SAGA installation path]/src/saga_core/saga_api

Log in as super user

>su

and execute the shell script 'saga_api_inst.sh'

>./saga_api_inst.sh

This will copy the SAGA API headers to '/usr/local/include', so they can be 
found by the gcc compiler.


2.0.2 Compiling module libraries

Test the installation by compiling some or all of module libraries either by 
using Visual Studio workspaces (e.g. 'D:\saga\src\modules\modules.dsw') or Linux 
make files. If this works you can use any of the library sources as template for 
your own projects.


Remarks:
Required SAGA API headers are:
api_core.h
dataobject.h
geo_tools.h
grid.h
mat_tools.h
tool.h
parameters.h
pdf_document.h
shapes.h
table.h
tin.h
saga_api.h

3 SAGA Developer Installation

3.1 MS-Windows

3.1.1 wxWidgets Cross-Platform GUI Library

version: wxWidgets 2.6.2
download: http://www.wxwidgets.org/
file: wxMSW-2.6.2.zip


Required libraries:
- wxexpat
- wxjpeg
- wxpng
- wxregex
- wxtiff
- wxzlib
- adv
- base
- core
- html
- odbc (optional)
- xml

Add an environment variable with the path to your wxWidgets installation:

>SET WXWIN = D:\DEVELOP\wxWidgets-2.6.2


3.1.2 wxFL


3.1.3 wxPropertyGrid

version: wxPropertyGrid 1.1.3 (January 15, 2006)
download: http://wxpropgrid.sourceforge.net/
file: wxpropgrid-1.1.3-src.tar.gz
>* SL >*
or file: wxpropgrid-1.1.4-win.exe
- run .exe file or unzip to wxWidgets directory
- open propgrid.dsw with MS VC++ from directory
  - ...\wxWidgets-x.x.x\contrib\build\propgrid\
  - compile Win32 Debug and Release versions with Build - Batch build
  
- using wxPropertyGrid version 1.1.3 or higher you need to
  change "wxPropertyGridManager" to "wxPropertyGrid"
  - in SAGA_gui source files: parameters_control.cpp and parameters_control.h
>* SL >*



3.1.3 wxDockIt (wxExtended)

version: wxDockIt 2.1 (July 23, 2005)
download: http://wxextended.sourceforge.net/
file: wxDockIt_2.1.zip

Remarks:
You probably get an error message when compiling wxDockIt using the VC makefiles 
from the command line due to a type definition conflict. You can simply solve 
this problem by removing the type definition in line 22 from file 'gdi_msw.cpp':

>typedef long LONG_PTR, *PLONG_PTR;

>* SL >*
Using the *.dsw files with MS VC++ compilers does probably not work.
Install from command prompt instead:
  - execute VCVARS32.BAT
  - Change to directory ...\wxDockit\build\msw
  - open makefile.vc with a text editor
    - check settings:
      - WX_SHARED = 0
      - WX_DEBUG  = 1  (debug version)
      - run nmake -fmakefile.vc from command prompt
    - change settings in makefile.vc
      - WX_DEBUG = 0 (release version)
      - save makefile.vc
      - run nmake -fmakefile.vc again to compile the release version as well
>* SL >*


3.1.4 Haru Free PDF Library

version: libharu 1.2.2 (May 21, 2005)
download: http://sourceforge.net/projects/libharu/
file: libharu_1_2_2_win.tar.gz

The Haru library sources provide makefiles for several compilers including 'makefile.msvc' 
for the VC++ compiler. After initialising the environment settings for the 
compiler (i.e. calling 'VCVARS32.BAT' in the VC installation directory), execute 
the makefile:

>D:\DEVELOP\HARU\nmake -f makefile.msvc

Add an environment variable with the path to your Haru installation:

>SET HARU = D:\DEVELOP\HARU

Remarks:
You might have to remove the '_NOT_SUPPORT_STD' define from the VCFLAGS in the 
file 'makefile.msvc' when using VC++ versions newer than 6.0

>VCFLAGS=-Imsvc -EHa -MT -TP -nologo -D__WIN32__



3.2 Linux

3.2.4 Haru Free PDF Library

version: libharu 1.2.2 (May 21, 2005)
download: http://sourceforge.net/projects/libharu/
file: libharu_1_2_2.tgz
