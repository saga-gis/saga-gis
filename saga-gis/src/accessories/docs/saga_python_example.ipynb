    "# A Short Introduction to PySAGA\n",

    "### Using PySAGA in *NIX-Like Environments\n",
    "*Linux*, *FreeBSD* and similar operating systems usually will have installed *SAGA* together with the *PySAGA* package after installation with your distribution's package manager. Alternatively you can build *SAGA* from the source code quite easily by yourself following the instructions from the [Wiki](https://sourceforge.net/p/saga-gis/wiki/Compiling%20SAGA%20on%20Linux/).\n",
    "### Using PySAGA in Windows Environments\n",
    "The Windows installation of *SAGA* is portable, i.e. you only need to unzip the binary files and can immediately run the programs, *saga_gui.exe* for starting the graphical user interface or *saga_cmd.exe* to run commands from a terminal or a batch script. To import *PySAGA* in your Python scripts you only need to add the path to your *SAGA* installation to the __PYTHONPATH__ environment variable. You can also do this programmatically within your Python script adding the following command line before trying to import anything from *PySAGA* (adjust the path accordingly):"
